                <h2><em>Nature 2</em></h2>
                <p>A publication examining the conflicted, constantly shifting relationship between nature and the
                    built environment, as well as the creation of a new, hybrid landscape combining the two: Nature 2.
                </p>
                <p>Historical and contemporary writings—anti-urban tracts, ecologies of bombed and abandoned
                    metropolises, utopian city plans, essays on industrial landscapes—are juxtaposed with
                    impressionistic imagery to investigate the fluid boundaries separating city and nature.</p>
