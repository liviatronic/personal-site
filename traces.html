                <h2><em>Traces</em></h2>
                <p>An interactive photo booth that—in the tradition of Victorian spirit photography and New Age aura
                    photography—reveals ghostly images of its past users.</p>
                <p>The photo booth and printed memento it
                    produces reflect on
                    alienation, community, and how we imbue
                    our technologies with the power to reveal and communicate with speculative worlds—from séances to
                    Second Life and Pokémon Go—that exist alongside our own.</p>

                    users.</p>
                <p>The grainy, low fidelity print on fragile receipt paper evokes the throwaway, impermanent feeling

                    a social media feed.</p>
