                <h2><em>Anxy</em> magazine</h2>
                <p><a href="https://anxymag.com/" target="_blank"><em>Anxy</em></a> explores mental health and our
                    inner worlds.
                    Each issue explores a central theme—“anger” or “workaholism”—through art, illustration, interviews,
                    personal essays, reported features, and visual stories. I led the design and art direction for the
                    magazine’s first three issues.</p>

                    typography, evoking a degraded photocopy. </p>

                <p>Melissa Spitz documents her intense relationship with her mentally ill mother through uncomfortably

                    hyper-feminine self presentation—but the saccharine aesthetic is undercut by stark typography and
                    off-balance layouts.
